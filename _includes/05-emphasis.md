Hello!
My name is **Yann**, I'm **20 years old** and I'm **French**. I live in **Bordeaux**. I'm very **open-minded, curious and tolerant**. By the way I'm single.

My aim is to discover another cultures, traditions and languages. I want to travel in **Asia** one day, it's one of my dream. However, I'm learning **English** and **Chinese**. And I'm a **native french speaker** guy, so if you want to improve your French, **I'm disponible**.

I'm a student in *"LEA" English-Chinese*. :)

Beside, I'm not a shy guy and I love talk about **every subject** with people from other place than mine.

**All countries and gender and are welcome. We can talk about any subject!**

I deeply hope hear/read from you, dear friend!

Yours,
Yann
